# Test case created on 13.10.2022, after the Spanish wordle that day:
# If a letter in green (or yellow) also appears now in black,
# then any word with one or more too many repetitions of that 
# letter can already be discarded. Examples:
# Guess 'impio' resulted in ---gg as clues, so any words that has
# the letter i repeated (e.g. tibio) could and should be discarded.
# After that, tried folio, an 'o' was still green but the
# additional 'o' was black. Same thing here then: any words
# with a repeated 'o' (e.g. gofio, obvio) should and could also be
# discarded after these last clues.
# (Final solution was junio)
