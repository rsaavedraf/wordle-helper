A python script to test the new processing and filtering logic to be used
in the python version of wordle-helper.

Usage:

./test_logic.py [OPTIONS]

Valid options are:

    -bFILE     : batch mode using FILE as input.

When used without the -b option, this script will interactively ask you to
provide the guesses you made for a Wordle challenge, as well as the clues
you got for each of them. In each step it will indicate what filtering
options the new processing logic should go through and produce as output.

Details about clue format and the wordle-helper script can be found in the
wordle helper help file.
