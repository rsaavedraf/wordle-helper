#
# This program progressively filters out all words
# that are no longer valid for a Wordle challenge,
# given your guesses so far, and the clues (green,
# yellow, or black) for each letter you've received
# in each guess.
#
# This script is not really intended to be optimal,
# just exercises the usage of some grep filtering,
# regular expressions, and bash programming.
